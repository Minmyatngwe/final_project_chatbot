# final_project_chatbot

## How to use?
Since TO USE OPEAN AI API ,there is limitation we use ollama large languare model,which is **llama3**

To use this chatbot we first need to download the llama3 llm
To download we first need to have ollma 
On the terminal type **"snap install ollama"**

After downloading **Type 'ollama' command on terminal you can see some output that means you successfully downloaded**
Next,we need to pull the largelanguage model that we are gonna use which is 'llama3'
To get that llama3 type this command **'ollama pull llama3'**
**After that you can run the python file**
## language detect

Since sometime languadetect libray thinks some common word like hello,hi bye not english because other languaes also has that kind of words.
### Recommendation
Our Recommendation is that instead of prompting only one or two words ,type full sentences to avoid that

## Prompting Time
Since the model we are using has 8 billion parameteors,the prompt time from the chat bot will be different based on the GPU AND CUP that your computer has.
